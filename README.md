# MELT GitHub Action

MELT is a GitHub action that generates comby rules for clients of a library when a pull request contains deprecations. Clients can use these comby rules to adapt to the changes in the library.

## Features

- Automatically generates comby rules from a pull request containing deprecations
- Easy integration with your GitHub workflow

## Usage

To use Fix It in your GitHub workflow, add the following snippet to your `.github/workflows/main.yml` file:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened]

  gen_rules:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Automatically generate comby rules from the request
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
